# client-server-communication-programs-based-on-Java-Socket-
#Sockets in Java which could be used to establish two-way communication
between two running programs (typically a client and a server) running on the network. But in principal
#A socket is just a way to send data (only data, not methods) on a port to a different host; it's up to you to define your own protocol.
